# EVA - Simplified Brief


|   Deadline	|   Before 10am on: 29/05/2020	|
|--- 	|--- 	|
|   Unit title & code	|   CIS016-1 Principles of Programming / CIS096-1 Principles of Programming and Data Structures	|
|   Weighting of Assessment	|   70%	|
|   Assessment type 	|   Code and Report // Presentation    |

> “Submit a word-processed report detailing the work that you have done. // Submit an individual video presentation about your work.”

## Deliverables 
1. Project Report (max 9000 words or 2 pages), 20% of grade.
    - Illustrate and justify your choices in analysis and implementation. ***Provide evidence that you actually tested your code.*** Any code may go into the appendix, except core classes that you may explain in the main text. 
    - This is a formal report and attention should be given to the format of this work. You should include a title page, table of contents, heading and sub-headings (introduction, main part, summary, appendices), and captions for figures.
    - You are strongly advised to use the report template provided. 

2. Each student, has to upload a short video of up to 5 minutes maximum where they vocally explain their contribution to the group project. Such an explanation should show the parts they implemented and explain some chosen example code they developed. 

3. A .zip file containing your running the complete program code, 50% of grade.
    - Instructions how to run the code should go into the project report above.
## Possible Discussion Topics for the Report

- Reflect upon your strength and weaknesses in relation to a programming project you have undertaken and use these to improve your program code 3
- Outline a test routine to check the logical correctness of a program you have written and provide the results of your testing demonstrating a working piece of code

## The Actual Task
### Extra-curricular eVent mAnagement (EVA)
Your task is to create a Java desktop application to create and manage student-led events at the university.
- Event Properties:
    - Online or Physical
        - Online => URL
        - Physical => Location
    - Title and description
    - Time and date
    - Place limitations (e.g. up to 30 participants)
- Student:
Student:
- Properties:
    - name
    - student ID
    - password
    - isOrganizer = True // False
        > “An administrator can provide a student with event organisation rights (essentially making a student an event organizer) or revoke these rights. The administrator can view all events and bookings. They can also cancel events or bookings.” 
- to Register:
    - name
    - student ID
    - password
- Login with (student ID, password):
    - Views:
        - (SHOW TO ALL STUDENTS)
            - Events View
                - Book events
            - Booked Events List View
                - Cancel Booking
        - (SHOW ONLY to ORGANIZER = YES)
            - Post Events View
            - View Listed Events View
                - Cancel Events
                    - Note: “In case of event cancellation all bookings associated with an event have to automatically be canceled, too.”
                - Modify Events
