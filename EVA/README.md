## Open the Existing Project

Before you run the project you should import the database into phpMyAdmin. [Go here.](./database/)

To open the existing project all that you have to do is open this folder in `IntelliJ IDEA`. 

If you want to use the Admin account that is added when importing the database use:
- User id: `1`
- Password: `adminpw`

To use any of the user accounts use:
- Password: `userpw`
