# EVA
Right now I'm working on creating all of the views, including the registration forms and validation of data. I am also slowly adding more on to the mySQL database, I haven't taken a dump of it yet but I can if any of you needs it, all you have to do then is import it into phpMyAdmin and it should automatically create all of the tables that i have (spoiler alert i haven't got that many at this point).

You should all familiarize yourselves with JavaFx and the FXML side of it, that will allow you to create some GUI's (check this [link](../Learning_Resources/JavaFx)), tho if you prefer to do something else, you can also look into how JDBC works and how I've implemented it here so that you can continue to add things. You should all hurry, time is passing, if you don't that's fine too, you're not in trouble.
