# EVA
Right now I'm working on creating all of the views, including the registration forms and validation of data. I am also slowly adding more on to the mySQL database, I haven't taken a dump of it yet but I can if any of you needs it, all you have to do then is import it into phpMyAdmin and it should automatically create all of the tables that i have (spoiler alert i haven't got that many at this point).

creating the basic layout please watch some tutorials of JavaFx so that you understand the basics of how to use it once the layout is finished.
Check this [link](../Learning_Resources/JavaFx).
